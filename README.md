# Algorithm.Class
First semester of Information System in Federal University of Juiz de Fora (Brasil). - Programming Course in C -

This is my repository of codes I wrote in my first programing class in University. 
Commands and difficulty are increased along the exercises, which most of them are very applicable to the day use. 
It was very pleasurable for me to start learning C. I hope you all enjoy!
